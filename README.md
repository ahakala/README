# Andy Hakala - Engineering Manager

As your manager, I look forward to getting to know more about both you and your work. I'd like to use this file as a jump-start for you to get to know a few things about me. 

#### Most importantly, I am here to help you contribute as many of your talents as possible. 

*Disclaimer - These are my views, not the views of my co-workers, my company, or my leaders. I will update this document as I mature and grow as a leader and as an engineer.*

## My Leadership Style 

I feel I am doing my best management when I am "hands-off". I brought you into this team because I believe that you have all the skills to take us to the next level. If you don't agree, let's talk. My job is to help you be successful!  

## My Values
 - I value high levels of customer engagement. Our best work happens when we collaborate with our customers. 

 - I value growth and discovery. We should push ourselves to solve for the present, with an eye towards the future. If we are not learning every day, we must pay more attention because we are missing valuable moments. 

 - I care less about where you have been and more about where you are going. This is not to minimize your previous experience, which is what got you to where you are today. Rather than recreate the past, I would love to see you push yourself, our team, and our company to new heights.

### Work-Life Balance
I have many things that I like to do when I am not at work. I am sure you do too. For this reason, I do not expect you to come in early or stay late on any kind of regular basis. There will be times where we must but I will do my best to keep them to a minimum. Sometimes you might see me online, working late at night. This **does not** mean that I expect you to do the same.

### Office Protocol
*Just some general day-to-day things for around the office*

#### Work Hours
I expect that you come to the office and keep a regular schedule. Generally, this means getting in sometime between 7am and 9am. Sometimes you will need to work from home and that works for me, but I would prefer that you do not work from home regularly. If that is a problem, we can talk about it. 

#### Asking Questions
I am a big fan of asking questions. I want you to feel empowered to make decisions to drive outcomes for our customers and the company. If you are ever unsure or need advice, please ask. My calendar may look full or I may seem busy, but I will always find (or make) time for your questions. 

#### 1 on 1's 
This is a new thing for me. I want these meetings to focus on what you need. They are more than just a status update. They'll be 30 minutes, once a week, but you can have more time if you need it.
