*Disclaimer - These are my views, not the views of my co-workers, my company, or my leaders. I will update this document as I mature and grow as a leader and as an engineer.*

# Andy Hakala - Engineering Leader

As your leader, I look forward to getting to know more about both you and your work. I'd like to use this file as a jump-start for you to get to know a few things about me. 

#### Most importantly, I am here to help you contribute as many of your talents as possible. 


## My Leadership Style 

I feel I am doing my best management when I am "hands-off". I brought you into this team because I believe that you have all the skills to take us to the next level. If you don't agree, let's talk. My job is to help you be successful!  

## My Values

Everyone is at a different point in their career journey and each journey has a unique destination. Some are just starting while others may be so lucky as to have public accolades regarding past contributions. Whatever the case, please remember that the world is a big place and there will always be someone with more experience, deeper understanding, and superior craft. Seek these individuals out and learn from them. 

 - I value high levels of customer engagement. Our best work happens when we collaborate with our customers. 

 - I value growth and discovery. We should push ourselves to solve for the present, with an eye towards the future. If we are not learning every day, we must pay more attention because we are missing valuable moments. 

 - I expect that you possess the technical background necessary to participate in successful outcomes at the apropriate level. Example: I wouldn't expect a project manager to be a master software developer. I would expect them to have (or gain) enough information to understand the work that is happening and carry meaningful conversations with the team.   

### Work-Life Balance
I have many things that I like to do when I am not at work. I am sure you do too. For this reason, I do not expect you to come in early or stay late on any kind of regular basis. There will be times where we must but I will do my best to keep them to a minimum. Sometimes you might see me online, working late at night. This **does not** mean that I expect you to do the same.

### Office Protocol
*Just some general day-to-day things for around the office*

#### Work Hours
I expect that you keep a regular schedule and be available for our customers. Generally, this means getting in sometime between 7am and 9am. Sometimes you will need to make exceptions and that works for me, but I would prefer that you stick to the schedule whenever possible. If that is a problem, we can talk about it. 

#### Asking Questions
I am a big fan of asking questions. I want you to feel empowered to make decisions to drive outcomes for our customers and the company. If you are ever unsure or need advice, please ask. My calendar may look full or I may seem busy, but I will always find (or make) time for your questions. 

#### 1 on 1's 
I want these meetings to focus on what you need. They are more than just a status update. They'll be 30 minutes, once a week, but you can have more time if you need it.
